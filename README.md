### Day 1
I was in New York for look for compelling stories for my blog. After a exhausting flight to New York, I was feeling jet-lagged and in need of relaxation. My friend suggested I go fishing to unwind, but I realized I didn't have any **bait**. I headed to a grocery store to pick some up, but instead of rushing, I decided to **chillax** and take my time. That's when I met a person who was using bait to catch some big ones. We struck up a conversation, and I learned that he ran a website that offered free Groupon deals. What surprised me most was that he'd built a 32 million dollar business without owning any physical properties or offices. It was an exciting conversation that left me feeling inspired and energized.

### Day 2
I was on the lookout for compelling stories for my blog, as I was set to leave the USA in a **fortnight**. My next destination was Texas, a place that had fascinated me since childhood. I had always been captivated by **fanzines** about the Texas lifestyle and their vibrant culture. During my journey, I was fortunate enough to sit next to a supporting character from the movie The Meanest Man in Texas. This unexpected encounter further awaken my interest in Texas. He shared numerous captivating stories that made Texas sound even more exhilarating than I had imagined. He confirmed that Texas was indeed the **raving** place I had always read about. As we landed and he took his next flight, I felt a surge of excitement. I was about to experience firsthand the vibrant world I had only known through fanzines.

### Day 3
I stumbled upon a remarkable story in a Texas science laboratory. While searching for inspiring tales for my blog, I met a student who turned **sci-fi** inspiration into reality. They were working on a revolutionary technology to combat **smog** and air pollution, converting it into oxygen - a breakthrough that could potentially make the Martian atmosphere breathable! What struck me was the contrast between our tendency to exploit **loopholes** in our systems and the dedication of these innovators to finding solutions. The student's demo left me amazed, unveiling the vast potential of this trillion-dollar industry. The encounter was a testament to human ingenuity and the power of sci-fi to spark real-world innovation, clearing the smog to reveal a brighter future.

### Day 4
Journey began, I boarded a train to California in search of fresh stories for my blog. Striking up a conversation with a fellow passenger, we started discussing the merits of **moped** engines. However, the conversation took an unexpected turn when they shared their perceptions of India, describing it as undeveloped and dirty, when I shared that how beautiful we developed India is, it was hard to believe them . They mentioned that certain **telecasts** had perpetuated a negative image of India, which would linger in the minds of Americans, making it challenging to change their perceptions. I listened intently, realizing the power of media telecasts in shaping global opinions and the need to showcase the real India to overcome such **lingering** misconceptions.
As I reached at my destination, I couldn't help but wonder: "Why don't we showcase the positive aspects of India to the world instead of highlighting our problems? We should focus on solving our issues internally, just like every city in the USA has its own set of challenges, but they don't broadcast them globally."
<hr/>
### Day 5
After reaching California, I took a refreshing nap and then headed to the park for a run and some exercise. As I sat on a bench, I struck up a conversation with a person beside me, asking about California and city life. The conversation took an intriguing turn when I discovered that he was an FBI agent. He shared some fascinating stories, including one about Pakistan, where businessmen funded an agent to create a **scandal** video to topple the government. Shockingly, the politician in question had embezzled public **Medicare** funds to build a personal **heliport**. Though I had to leave for my next meeting to gather more content for my blog, the encounter left me with a lasting impression of the intricate workings of global politics and the darker side of power struggles, where **scandal** and corruption can lead to exploitation of public resources like **Medicare** for personal gain, even something as extravagant as a **heliport**.
<hr/>
### Day 6
I was searching for stories to share on my blog. I met up with a friend who is a neurosurgeon in California. Initially, I hesitated when he requested that I visit a hospice with him, but after his second request, I agreed to go. While at the **hospice**, a lady passing by gave me a warm **smiggle** . I was curious about the people there, individuals on the brink of death who still managed to keep the **momentum** of life alive. Intrigued, I asked them questions about their lives. I was amazed by their responses. One lady, a pilot, shared numerous stories about her good and bad experiences and her travels. She smiled and said to me, "Man, live your life to the fullest. If you ever get an expiration date on your life, you'll regret not living it fully."  When I was about to leave, with tears in my eyes, She added that as humans, we have the luxury to travel, eat, run, and do researchâ€”luxuries that many species do not have.
Her words left me questioning: Are we truly living our lives to the fullest?
<hr/>
### Day 7
I left California and arrived in Delaware, seeking new stories for my blog. I shared a cab with two fellow passengers, who suggested I try **alcopop**, a drink I politely declined due to my non-alcoholic preferences. This sparked an intriguing conversation, revealing the **heinous** truth behind the production of **alcopop**. My companions shared stories of how Black people were forced to work in scorching sunlight for over 18 hours to extract the ingredients, perpetuating a long history of exploitation. They spoke of a disturbing **Zeitgeist**, where alcopop was once seen as a privilege reserved for White people, highlighting the dark history of racial inequality in the country. Despite progress, Black people continue to fight for their rights, and their stories serve as a poignant reminder of the ongoing struggle for true equality.

It may take some time; please move on to the next day.
<hr/>
### Day 9
I apologize for being busy over the last three days and not being able to send the blogs as promised. When I arrived in Delaware for work, I had an interesting encounter in the cafeteria while having coffee. I met an Indian guy who was there to design **edutainment** games for infants. He told me that he got the idea from a scene in a Skyoctober movie where someone used **Docusoap** to build a rocket. Our conversation about new technologies was fascinating. He mentioned that many children are becoming **peevish** due to violent games.
I asked him if it was really necessary to introduce infants to edutainment games and expose them to technology at such a young age. Wouldn't it contribute to their peevish behavior? He responded with another example from a docusoap movie. It was an enlightening discussion, but I had to leave to meet a friend. As I walked away, I was left pondering whether edutainment is the only way forward for our children.
<hr/>
### Day 10
I was at the Delaware airport, waiting to board my flight to Atlanta. I was fascinated by a young girl enthusiastically playing with a robot, **nuzzling** and talking to it, unaware that it was just a **robocall**. Her parents, engrossed in listening to a **podcast**, seemed oblivious to their daughter's interaction with the robot. As their podcast ended, I initiated a conversation with them, inquiring about the potential consequences of excessive technology on their child's life. As scientists, they shared their concerns about the potential risks of lacking technological skills, which could lead to bullying and struggles in the digital age. As the boarding announcement interrupted our conversation, I said them bye, left pondering the question: is it essential to expose our children to so much technology, and what are the implications of doing so? The image of the girl nuzzling the robot, and the parents engrossed in their podcast, lingered in my mind, highlighting the complexities of our tech-driven world.
<hr/>
### Day 11
I arrived in Atlanta looking for compelling stories for my blog. After having brunch, I was tired and decided to take a nap. In the evening, when I woke up, I went to a **multiplex** to watch a movie called "The Fall Guy." I noticed a man sitting next to me, waiting to enter the multiplex. I initiated a conversation. He **resembled** a true hero, sitting in a wheelchair and wearing a black **pleather** jacket. He told me he was in the armed forces and had been posted in Afghanistan. We had a wonderful discussion about the current situation over there. He lost his leg while protecting 230 students from a terrorist attack at a school.
When the announcement for the movie was made, I said goodbye to him with great pride. As I walked away, a question pondered in my mind: why do these soldiers never think about themselves, regardless of the flag they serve under? In the corporate world, we are taught to be selfish, but what would happen to any country if its soldiers were selfish?
<hr/>
### Day 12
I was en route to Georgia Tech Atlanta University to meet a friend and uncover compelling stories for my blog. But my plans were disrupted when I received a call from my parents, who were on a **staycation**. They broke the news that an attempt had been made to **assassinate** Trump, which I initially thought was exaggerated. However, the **simultaneous** broadcast on both radio and television, known as a simulcast, confirmed the shocking truth. Adding to my disbelief, a message popped up on my phone announcing a two-day closure of the Georgia campus. I was left stunned, realizing that even in a country that boasts of its advancements, there are still significant loopholes in the system. The incident lingered in my mind, raising questions about the harsh realities of power struggles and the vulnerability of leaders and their families to assassination attempts.
<hr/>
### Day 13
I planned to visit Atlanta but couldn't due to the Trump incident and feeling quite **lethargic**. After campus opened, I met up with my friend Abhishek, a graduate student at Georgia Tech. I was eager to hear about his life, especially how he manages to work in three different places to cover tuition, rent, and groceries, all while getting only four hours of sleep. I found it fascinating how he juggles work and classes. Abhishek shared wonderful stories about university life and much more before he had to rush off to work. As I wandered the city for more compelling stories for my blog, I couldn't shake off the question lingering in my mind: Why do students in their 20s often complain about being busy without earning, while others like Abhishek work tirelessly on minimal sleep?
<hr/>
### Day 14
I as I waited at Atlanta airport for my next flight to Florida for compelling stories for my blog, I couldn't forget the conversation I had with a couple and their 11 Year-old daughter. She had been **diagnosed** with Alzheimer's, and their struggles navigating the healthcare system stayed with me. I wondered how many more people were facing similar challenges, and why a country like the USA, which appears so fascinating from the outside, was struggling to serve its people's basic needs. I made a mental note to delve deeper into this issue, to understand the complexities of the healthcare system and the challenges people face in accessing quality care. My USA journey was turning out to be a eye-opening experience, and I was determined to share the stories I was collecting with the world.
<hr/>
### Day 15
I arrived in Florida eager to discover compelling stories for my blog. I quickly made my way to meet a friend who works as an engineer at a hydroelectric plant construction site. This was my first encounter with a dam and hydroelectric plant, sparking childhood excitement and curiosity about these structures. As my friend shared insider details about their operations, it left me pondering the origins of such human-made infrastructure like **embankments** and dams, and what motivates us to undertake such monumental construction projects.
<hr/>
### Day 16
I found myself in Florida, sitting in a restaurant having brunch and brainstorming new stories for my blog. Suddenly, I heard a Hindi song playing behind me, which led to a conversation with an American guy whose parents were originally from India. Intrigued, I asked about his parents' journey. He shared that his parents were snake catchers in India, performing snake shows. An American circus owner invited them to the USA, and their show became a hit in the 1980s. However, this success brought about enormous problems in Florida, where pythons started killing native animals. He showed me some videos of his father with these enormous pythons, which was fascinating. He even invited me to dinner, but I had to leave for another meeting with a friend. As I left, I couldn't stop pondering the question: how can an opportunity change your life so drastically? A small chance can create wonders. The snake catcher's son became a doctor, and his daughter is now a banker. Can we create such opportunities regardless of financial background?
<hr/>
### Day 17
I was brainstorming new stories to add to my blog, which led me to sleep very late at night. Suddenly, I heard a **cacophony** outside my hotel. I asked the hotel staff about the commotion and was told that it was a **picket** against the **embankment** of rivers, which was destroying the natural flow of the water. Intrigued, I visited the protest site and inquired about the reasons and causes. One of the protestors explained that the government had **expedited** the embankment process, which was ruining the beauty of Florida's rivers. He mentioned that this could cause **enormous** changes in the city and climate, potentially triggering earthquakes. He also shared a personal story: his daughter had been **diagnosed** with waterborne diseases, which he attributed to these structures.
I had to leave for my next meeting, so I bid him goodbye and promised to write about the issue. As I walked away, a question lingered in my mind: Why can't humans use natural resources without harming them? Why do we always have to alter the way nature works?
