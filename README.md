### Day 1
I was in New York for look for compelling stories for my blog. After a exhausting flight to New York, I was feeling jet-lagged and in need of relaxation. My friend suggested I go fishing to unwind, but I realized I didn't have any **bait**. I headed to a grocery store to pick some up, but instead of rushing, I decided to **chillax** and take my time. That's when I met a person who was using bait to catch some big ones. We struck up a conversation, and I learned that he ran a website that offered free Groupon deals. What surprised me most was that he'd built a 32 million dollar business without owning any physical properties or offices. It was an exciting conversation that left me feeling inspired and energized.

### Day 2
I was on the lookout for compelling stories for my blog, as I was set to leave the USA in a **fortnight**. My next destination was Texas, a place that had fascinated me since childhood. I had always been captivated by **fanzines** about the Texas lifestyle and their vibrant culture. During my journey, I was fortunate enough to sit next to a supporting character from the movie The Meanest Man in Texas. This unexpected encounter further awaken my interest in Texas. He shared numerous captivating stories that made Texas sound even more exhilarating than I had imagined. He confirmed that Texas was indeed the **raving** place I had always read about. As we landed and he took his next flight, I felt a surge of excitement. I was about to experience firsthand the vibrant world I had only known through fanzines.

### Day 3
I stumbled upon a remarkable story in a Texas science laboratory. While searching for inspiring tales for my blog, I met a student who turned **sci-fi** inspiration into reality. They were working on a revolutionary technology to combat **smog** and air pollution, converting it into oxygen - a breakthrough that could potentially make the Martian atmosphere breathable! What struck me was the contrast between our tendency to exploit **loopholes** in our systems and the dedication of these innovators to finding solutions. The student's demo left me amazed, unveiling the vast potential of this trillion-dollar industry. The encounter was a testament to human ingenuity and the power of sci-fi to spark real-world innovation, clearing the smog to reveal a brighter future.

### Day 4
Journey began, I boarded a train to California in search of fresh stories for my blog. Striking up a conversation with a fellow passenger, we started discussing the merits of **moped** engines. However, the conversation took an unexpected turn when they shared their perceptions of India, describing it as undeveloped and dirty, when I shared that how beautiful we developed India is, it was hard to believe them . They mentioned that certain **telecasts** had perpetuated a negative image of India, which would linger in the minds of Americans, making it challenging to change their perceptions. I listened intently, realizing the power of media telecasts in shaping global opinions and the need to showcase the real India to overcome such **lingering** misconceptions.
As I reached at my destination, I couldn't help but wonder: "Why don't we showcase the positive aspects of India to the world instead of highlighting our problems? We should focus on solving our issues internally, just like every city in the USA has its own set of challenges, but they don't broadcast them globally."

### Day 5
After reaching California, I took a refreshing nap and then headed to the park for a run and some exercise. As I sat on a bench, I struck up a conversation with a person beside me, asking about California and city life. The conversation took an intriguing turn when I discovered that he was an FBI agent. He shared some fascinating stories, including one about Pakistan, where businessmen funded an agent to create a **scandal** video to topple the government. Shockingly, the politician in question had embezzled public **Medicare** funds to build a personal **heliport**. Though I had to leave for my next meeting to gather more content for my blog, the encounter left me with a lasting impression of the intricate workings of global politics and the darker side of power struggles, where **scandal** and corruption can lead to exploitation of public resources like **Medicare** for personal gain, even something as extravagant as a **heliport**.

### Day 6
I was searching for stories to share on my blog. I met up with a friend who is a neurosurgeon in California. Initially, I hesitated when he requested that I visit a hospice with him, but after his second request, I agreed to go. While at the **hospice**, a lady passing by gave me a warm **smiggle** . I was curious about the people there, individuals on the brink of death who still managed to keep the **momentum** of life alive. Intrigued, I asked them questions about their lives. I was amazed by their responses. One lady, a pilot, shared numerous stories about her good and bad experiences and her travels. She smiled and said to me, "Man, live your life to the fullest. If you ever get an expiration date on your life, you'll regret not living it fully."  When I was about to leave, with tears in my eyes, She added that as humans, we have the luxury to travel, eat, run, and do researchâ€”luxuries that many species do not have.
Her words left me questioning: Are we truly living our lives to the fullest?

### Day 7
I left California and arrived in Delaware, seeking new stories for my blog. I shared a cab with two fellow passengers, who suggested I try **alcopop**, a drink I politely declined due to my non-alcoholic preferences. This sparked an intriguing conversation, revealing the **heinous** truth behind the production of **alcopop**. My companions shared stories of how Black people were forced to work in scorching sunlight for over 18 hours to extract the ingredients, perpetuating a long history of exploitation. They spoke of a disturbing **Zeitgeist**, where alcopop was once seen as a privilege reserved for White people, highlighting the dark history of racial inequality in the country. Despite progress, Black people continue to fight for their rights, and their stories serve as a poignant reminder of the ongoing struggle for true equality.
