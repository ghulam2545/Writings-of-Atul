### Day 1
I was in New York for look for compelling stories for my blog. After a exhausting flight to New York, I was feeling jet-lagged and in need of relaxation. My friend suggested I go fishing to unwind, but I realized I didn't have any **bait**. I headed to a grocery store to pick some up, but instead of rushing, I decided to **chillax** and take my time. That's when I met a person who was using bait to catch some big ones. We struck up a conversation, and I learned that he ran a website that offered free Groupon deals. What surprised me most was that he'd built a 32 million dollar business without owning any physical properties or offices. It was an exciting conversation that left me feeling inspired and energized.
<hr/>
### Day 2
I was on the lookout for compelling stories for my blog, as I was set to leave the USA in a **fortnight**. My next destination was Texas, a place that had fascinated me since childhood. I had always been captivated by **fanzines** about the Texas lifestyle and their vibrant culture. During my journey, I was fortunate enough to sit next to a supporting character from the movie The Meanest Man in Texas. This unexpected encounter further awaken my interest in Texas. He shared numerous captivating stories that made Texas sound even more exhilarating than I had imagined. He confirmed that Texas was indeed the **raving** place I had always read about. As we landed and he took his next flight, I felt a surge of excitement. I was about to experience firsthand the vibrant world I had only known through fanzines.
<hr/>
### Day 3
I stumbled upon a remarkable story in a Texas science laboratory. While searching for inspiring tales for my blog, I met a student who turned **sci-fi** inspiration into reality. They were working on a revolutionary technology to combat **smog** and air pollution, converting it into oxygen - a breakthrough that could potentially make the Martian atmosphere breathable! What struck me was the contrast between our tendency to exploit **loopholes** in our systems and the dedication of these innovators to finding solutions. The student's demo left me amazed, unveiling the vast potential of this trillion-dollar industry. The encounter was a testament to human ingenuity and the power of sci-fi to spark real-world innovation, clearing the smog to reveal a brighter future.
<hr/>
### Day 4
Journey began, I boarded a train to California in search of fresh stories for my blog. Striking up a conversation with a fellow passenger, we started discussing the merits of **moped** engines. However, the conversation took an unexpected turn when they shared their perceptions of India, describing it as undeveloped and dirty, when I shared that how beautiful we developed India is, it was hard to believe them . They mentioned that certain **telecasts** had perpetuated a negative image of India, which would linger in the minds of Americans, making it challenging to change their perceptions. I listened intently, realizing the power of media telecasts in shaping global opinions and the need to showcase the real India to overcome such **lingering** misconceptions.
As I reached at my destination, I couldn't help but wonder: "Why don't we showcase the positive aspects of India to the world instead of highlighting our problems? We should focus on solving our issues internally, just like every city in the USA has its own set of challenges, but they don't broadcast them globally."
<hr/>
### Day 5
After reaching California, I took a refreshing nap and then headed to the park for a run and some exercise. As I sat on a bench, I struck up a conversation with a person beside me, asking about California and city life. The conversation took an intriguing turn when I discovered that he was an FBI agent. He shared some fascinating stories, including one about Pakistan, where businessmen funded an agent to create a **scandal** video to topple the government. Shockingly, the politician in question had embezzled public **Medicare** funds to build a personal **heliport**. Though I had to leave for my next meeting to gather more content for my blog, the encounter left me with a lasting impression of the intricate workings of global politics and the darker side of power struggles, where **scandal** and corruption can lead to exploitation of public resources like **Medicare** for personal gain, even something as extravagant as a **heliport**.
<hr/>
### Day 6
I was searching for stories to share on my blog. I met up with a friend who is a neurosurgeon in California. Initially, I hesitated when he requested that I visit a hospice with him, but after his second request, I agreed to go. While at the **hospice**, a lady passing by gave me a warm **smiggle** . I was curious about the people there, individuals on the brink of death who still managed to keep the **momentum** of life alive. Intrigued, I asked them questions about their lives. I was amazed by their responses. One lady, a pilot, shared numerous stories about her good and bad experiences and her travels. She smiled and said to me, "Man, live your life to the fullest. If you ever get an expiration date on your life, you'll regret not living it fully."  When I was about to leave, with tears in my eyes, She added that as humans, we have the luxury to travel, eat, run, and do research—luxuries that many species do not have.
Her words left me questioning: Are we truly living our lives to the fullest?
<hr/>
### Day 7
I left California and arrived in Delaware, seeking new stories for my blog. I shared a cab with two fellow passengers, who suggested I try **alcopop**, a drink I politely declined due to my non-alcoholic preferences. This sparked an intriguing conversation, revealing the **heinous** truth behind the production of **alcopop**. My companions shared stories of how Black people were forced to work in scorching sunlight for over 18 hours to extract the ingredients, perpetuating a long history of exploitation. They spoke of a disturbing **Zeitgeist**, where alcopop was once seen as a privilege reserved for White people, highlighting the dark history of racial inequality in the country. Despite progress, Black people continue to fight for their rights, and their stories serve as a poignant reminder of the ongoing struggle for true equality.
<hr/>
### Day 8
**Fetching...** <br/>
It may take some time; please move on to the next day.
<hr/>
### Day 9
I apologize for being busy over the last three days and not being able to send the blogs as promised. When I arrived in Delaware for work, I had an interesting encounter in the cafeteria while having coffee. I met an Indian guy who was there to design **edutainment** games for infants. He told me that he got the idea from a scene in a Skyoctober movie where someone used **Docusoap** to build a rocket. Our conversation about new technologies was fascinating. He mentioned that many children are becoming **peevish** due to violent games.
I asked him if it was really necessary to introduce infants to edutainment games and expose them to technology at such a young age. Wouldn't it contribute to their peevish behavior? He responded with another example from a docusoap movie. It was an enlightening discussion, but I had to leave to meet a friend. As I walked away, I was left pondering whether edutainment is the only way forward for our children.
<hr/>
### Day 10
I was at the Delaware airport, waiting to board my flight to Atlanta. I was fascinated by a young girl enthusiastically playing with a robot, **nuzzling** and talking to it, unaware that it was just a **robocall**. Her parents, engrossed in listening to a **podcast**, seemed oblivious to their daughter's interaction with the robot. As their podcast ended, I initiated a conversation with them, inquiring about the potential consequences of excessive technology on their child's life. As scientists, they shared their concerns about the potential risks of lacking technological skills, which could lead to bullying and struggles in the digital age. As the boarding announcement interrupted our conversation, I said them bye, left pondering the question: is it essential to expose our children to so much technology, and what are the implications of doing so? The image of the girl nuzzling the robot, and the parents engrossed in their podcast, lingered in my mind, highlighting the complexities of our tech-driven world.
<hr/>
### Day 11
I arrived in Atlanta looking for compelling stories for my blog. After having brunch, I was tired and decided to take a nap. In the evening, when I woke up, I went to a **multiplex** to watch a movie called "The Fall Guy." I noticed a man sitting next to me, waiting to enter the multiplex. I initiated a conversation. He **resembled** a true hero, sitting in a wheelchair and wearing a black **pleather** jacket. He told me he was in the armed forces and had been posted in Afghanistan. We had a wonderful discussion about the current situation over there. He lost his leg while protecting 230 students from a terrorist attack at a school.
When the announcement for the movie was made, I said goodbye to him with great pride. As I walked away, a question pondered in my mind: why do these soldiers never think about themselves, regardless of the flag they serve under? In the corporate world, we are taught to be selfish, but what would happen to any country if its soldiers were selfish?
<hr/>
### Day 12
I was en route to Georgia Tech Atlanta University to meet a friend and uncover compelling stories for my blog. But my plans were disrupted when I received a call from my parents, who were on a **staycation**. They broke the news that an attempt had been made to **assassinate** Trump, which I initially thought was exaggerated. However, the **simultaneous** broadcast on both radio and television, known as a simulcast, confirmed the shocking truth. Adding to my disbelief, a message popped up on my phone announcing a two-day closure of the Georgia campus. I was left stunned, realizing that even in a country that boasts of its advancements, there are still significant loopholes in the system. The incident lingered in my mind, raising questions about the harsh realities of power struggles and the vulnerability of leaders and their families to assassination attempts.
<hr/>
### Day 13
I planned to visit Atlanta but couldn't due to the Trump incident and feeling quite **lethargic**. After campus opened, I met up with my friend Abhishek, a graduate student at Georgia Tech. I was eager to hear about his life, especially how he manages to work in three different places to cover tuition, rent, and groceries, all while getting only four hours of sleep. I found it fascinating how he juggles work and classes. Abhishek shared wonderful stories about university life and much more before he had to rush off to work. As I wandered the city for more compelling stories for my blog, I couldn't shake off the question lingering in my mind: Why do students in their 20s often complain about being busy without earning, while others like Abhishek work tirelessly on minimal sleep?
<hr/>
### Day 14
I as I waited at Atlanta airport for my next flight to Florida for compelling stories for my blog, I couldn't forget the conversation I had with a couple and their 11 Year-old daughter. She had been **diagnosed** with Alzheimer's, and their struggles navigating the healthcare system stayed with me. I wondered how many more people were facing similar challenges, and why a country like the USA, which appears so fascinating from the outside, was struggling to serve its people's basic needs. I made a mental note to delve deeper into this issue, to understand the complexities of the healthcare system and the challenges people face in accessing quality care. My USA journey was turning out to be a eye-opening experience, and I was determined to share the stories I was collecting with the world.
<hr/>
### Day 15
I arrived in Florida eager to discover compelling stories for my blog. I quickly made my way to meet a friend who works as an engineer at a hydroelectric plant construction site. This was my first encounter with a dam and hydroelectric plant, sparking childhood excitement and curiosity about these structures. As my friend shared insider details about their operations, it left me pondering the origins of such human-made infrastructure like **embankments** and dams, and what motivates us to undertake such monumental construction projects.
<hr/>
### Day 16
I found myself in Florida, sitting in a restaurant having brunch and brainstorming new stories for my blog. Suddenly, I heard a Hindi song playing behind me, which led to a conversation with an American guy whose parents were originally from India. Intrigued, I asked about his parents' journey. He shared that his parents were snake catchers in India, performing snake shows. An American circus owner invited them to the USA, and their show became a hit in the 1980s. However, this success brought about enormous problems in Florida, where pythons started killing native animals. He showed me some videos of his father with these enormous pythons, which was fascinating. He even invited me to dinner, but I had to leave for another meeting with a friend. As I left, I couldn't stop pondering the question: how can an opportunity change your life so drastically? A small chance can create wonders. The snake catcher's son became a doctor, and his daughter is now a banker. Can we create such opportunities regardless of financial background?
<hr/>
### Day 17
I was brainstorming new stories to add to my blog, which led me to sleep very late at night. Suddenly, I heard a **cacophony** outside my hotel. I asked the hotel staff about the commotion and was told that it was a **picket** against the **embankment** of rivers, which was destroying the natural flow of the water. Intrigued, I visited the protest site and inquired about the reasons and causes. One of the protestors explained that the government had **expedited** the embankment process, which was ruining the beauty of Florida's rivers. He mentioned that this could cause **enormous** changes in the city and climate, potentially triggering earthquakes. He also shared a personal story: his daughter had been **diagnosed** with waterborne diseases, which he attributed to these structures.
I had to leave for my next meeting, so I bid him goodbye and promised to write about the issue. As I walked away, a question lingered in my mind: Why can't humans use natural resources without harming them? Why do we always have to alter the way nature works?
<hr/>
### Day 18
I was sleeping when someone knocked on my door at 5:30 in the morning. When I checked, it was the hotel staff delivering an envelope from the Florida police department. They had **summoned** me for some questions about yesterday's protest and advised me not to get involved in protests, warning that it might be problematic for me. I explained everything, and they agreed on some of the points I shared. They also inquired with my friends and the hotel staff about my stay. It was a bit embarrassing, but I knew I hadn't done anything wrong. However, it was also a bit scary and problematic to receive a **summons** without knowing the laws of the land. I packed my stuff and went to the airport, heading to Boston to look for new stories for my blog. This situation made me ponder: who gives them the authority to interrogate someone for participating in a protest? Why can't we participate in protests regardless of our nationality?
<hr/>
### Day 19
I was sitting on an airplane, pondering new stories for my blog. A young couple seated next to me began debating about the Rajendra Nagar and Patel Nagar incident in Delhi. Intrigued, I joined their conversation about the horrifying event. They revealed that they had both been policymakers in India for a few years. They shared their perspective on how the country seemed reserved for only a select few, mentioning many things that I can't disclose here. They expressed concern that four of the nation's best resources had died in the incident, yet the broader public appeared indifferent. While students protested, they believed that all citizens should rise up to demand a better country. They also warned that we are on the brink of depleting our natural resources.
As our flight neared Boston, I realized how absorbed I had been in the discussion—the four hours had flown by without me noticing. A question lingered in my mind: Are we, as citizens of India, apathetic to the point of being metaphorically dead? This incident could happen to anyone, yet it seems we remain largely unconcerned. This **notion** is important, and I felt a renewed sense of urgency to address these issues in my writing.
<hr/>
### Day 20
After arriving in Boston, I called my friend from the airport. He works as a scientist at a Boston environmental research center. The drive to our destination took 1.5 hours, during which I decided to bring up the topic of the environment. He passionately discussed the challenges of environmental collapse and the impact of global warming on various species. He emphasized that while issues like global warming are critical, the **transient** trends in fashion also pose significant environmental challenges. His research center invests millions of dollars into understanding and mitigating these complex issues. As we arrived at our destination, I couldn't help but wonder why our country isn't taking more proactive steps to establish similar research institutions and fund numerous scholarships aimed at addressing these pressing environmental concerns.
<hr/>
### Day 21
I worked late into the night to looking for compelling stories for my blog, so I ended up sleeping very late in the morning. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door—it was a friend who was heading to the UPS store to renew his **lease** agreement. He asked if I wanted to join him, and I agreed. The drive was about 30 minutes from his house, and the weather was beautiful. I initially thought it would take the entire day, but I mentioned that I wanted to stop at Starbucks to get coffee. My friend agreed, and I quickly grabbed my coffee, which only took 15 minutes. During this time, I received a call from his family, and he went to UPS Store, and whole process took 30 minutes.
I was amazed at how efficiently everything was managed here. In contrast, in India, such processes often take an entire day or even longer. The transparency and efficiency here are stark contrasts. My friend mentioned that some UPS store managers also handle vehicle registrations and other services. I spent the whole day pondering why in India these authorities take so long and lack transparency, forcing working individuals to waste valuable time and sometimes resort to bribery to expedite processes.
<hr/>
### Day 22
I was staying at a friend's house in Boston, searching for compelling stories for my blog. After a series of meetings, I craved a traditional Indian breakfast and headed to a nearby restaurant. As I entered, I was struck by the chef **grinding** spices manually. It was a rare sight, as most restaurants opt for pre-packaged spices. My curiosity was piqued, and I asked the chef about this unusual practice.
He shared that they had previously used packet spices, but wanted to differentiate themselves from others. By grinding spices through an ancient process, they discovered a distinct flavor that set them apart. This encounter left me pondering a crucial question: why do we hastily adopt technology without understanding its impact? In India, the wealthy classes have embraced ancient techniques, while the poor and middle class rush to bring machines into their homes, often without considering the value of traditional methods. The simple act of grinding spices had sparked a profound reflection on our relationship with technology and tradition.
<hr/>
### Day 23
I received an intriguing conference invitation at a university to explore the **harnessing** of Mars' resources. Eager to uncover compelling stories for my blog, I attended the event and met an MIT Engineer dedicated to this innovative field. Our conversation revealed that the US government and private institutions are investing heavily in harnessing energy from other planets, with a surprising focus on asteroid mining. As I departed for my next conference, I couldn't shake off the thought: why are we exploiting every planet and asteroid? Are humans destined to collapse the entire universe? Or, as someone from a third-world country, am I simply not privy to the concerns that drive these endeavors? The importance of harnessing resources had sparked a profound reflection on humanity's relationship with the cosmos.
<hr/>
### Day 24
I arrived in Baltimore eager to uncover new stories for my blog. After reaching there, I decided to dine at a Thai restaurant. As I waited for my food, I couldn't help but overhear a nearby group of couples passionately debating the concept of first-world countries **lugging** the burden of third-world nations. Their discussion struck me deeply, especially since the waiter and chef were from Asia and Africa respectively.
Intrigued, I joined their conversation and discovered a multitude of perspectives. We discussed how developed nations often **harness** resources from less developed regions, prompting me to ponder the concept of **narcissism** in global dynamics. These 'hunters' of resources seemed unaware of their own privilege, forgetting the impactful words of Shashi Tharoor on this very topic.
Reflecting on the evening, I couldn't shake the lingering question: how can these individuals justify such selfishness when their prosperity often comes at the expense of others? The encounter left me with a renewed perspective on the complexities of global relationships and the ethical responsibilities that accompany privilege.
<hr/>
### Day 25
I was scrolling through LinkedIn to connect with professionals in Baltimore for compelling stories for my blog. I came across an Indian-origin scientist at Johns Hopkins University. After connecting on LinkedIn, he invited me to the university to see a **sophisticated** machine used for decoding DNA. It was mesmerizing to understand the complexity of DNA and its potential to cure diseases and disabilities before birth. Curious, I asked the professor if we might create superhumans with this technology. He laughed and replied, "No, Atul, our primary goal is to cure genetic diseases." I plan to share his story in an upcoming blog about a boy from UP who achieved remarkable excellence in his field.
This experience left me pondering whether these institutions are like places of worship and what they are truly doing for humanity, making us special among all species on this planet.
<hr/>
### Day 26
I was scrolling through the internet, looking for the best places to visit in Baltimore to compelling stories for my blog. Around midnight, I got a call from a friend who urged me to visit the George Peabody Library and the Walters Art Gallery. He insisted, saying, "You would **rue** not visiting these places. "At first, I was skeptical—who goes to a library and an art gallery on a trip? I decided not to go, but then I reconsidered and thought maybe I should give it a chance.
The next day, I visited these places, and I must say, they were stunningly beautiful and mesmerizing. I couldn't believe the architecture and the sheer size of these places. The George Peabody Library was the most amazing and largest library I've ever seen in my life. As for the Walters Art Gallery, I would highly recommend it to all my viewers. It's a testament to human imagination and the power of art. The gallery holds a collection from the mid-19th century, offering a peaceful experience, with some pieces being the rarest on the planet.
As I made my way back to my hotel, I couldn't stop wondering why we aren't building libraries like the George Peabody Library anymore. Why aren't we investing in such cultural treasures? Are we going to **rue** not creating such places in the future?
<hr/>
### Day 27
After **grinding** through countless meetings over the past few days, I decided it was time for a break. I chose to spend the day at Baltimore Beach, where I **lay** on the warm sand, basking in the sun for hours. Nearby, children played with water toys, while others were **harnessing** their creativity to build intricate sand structures. They weren’t **lugging** the weight of expectations or striving to perform at their best—they were simply happy, with no **rue** for the future or concern about what they might achieve.
In contrast, we adults are often caught up in the most **sophisticated** machines designed by humans, which can lead us down a path of **narcissism**. We grind away, **harnessing** every ounce of our potential, not for our own joy, but to become the best resources for someone else. As I said goodbye to the beach, my mind began storming with thoughts, searching for compelling stories for my blog. It made me wonder: why can't we be happy? Why do we invest our best time in activities that drain us when we could be enjoying life and making it more fun?
<hr/>
### Day 28
After refreshing myself at the beach, I decided to try Malaysian food despite my **cynical** attitude towards new cuisines. As an Indian, I usually prefer Indian food. At the Blue Island restaurant, I asked the chef what I should try, and he recommended nasi lemak. It was an amazing dish with rice, pandan, coconut milk, and various chutneys. It made my day, and I wrote a special note for the chef and left a tip. 
As I walked back to my hotel, I pondered why we are so **cynical** about trying new things. I realized that this cynicism often extends beyond food to many aspects of life. Embracing new experiences might lead to some of the best moments of our lives.
<hr/>
### Day 29
I spent the early morning **improvising** my speech. I had been invited to speak at a Junior high school in Baltimore to share my experiences of traveling to different countries. I was tense, unsure of how to convey my experiences to the students, and a bit afraid. Seeking reassurance, I called my mother. She was calm and confident, telling me that she believed I would do my best. Despite knowing little about traveling, her words gave me the courage I needed to deliver my speech.
During the session, I shared my travel experiences with the students, who asked a wide range of questions about traveling—expenses, accommodations, and whether it’s safe for girls to travel alone. They were curious about Asia and much more. After answering all their questions, I reflected on the way back. Our parents have an incredible ability to boost our morale. They believe in us just a little more than anyone else. Yet, we often avoid talking to them about our problems, not giving them a chance to understand or support us.
<hr/>
### Day 30
I was exploring the internet to find more intriguing places for compelling stories for my blog when I came across some disturbing news about Vinesh Phogat. I felt a deep sense of disappointment and **impotent** frustration because, despite her reaching the finals of wrestling, she didn't win. It was heartbreaking, and I decided to write about it on my blog and raise awareness within the community.
After spending over four hours online, I couldn't understand how such issues could cause a loss in the medal round. As a country, we should invest more in various sports to create more opportunities and improve our chances on the global stage.
<hr/>
### Day 100
I had planned a city exploration trip with a group and was thrilled at the idea of meeting new people. As I was traveling solo, I ended up striking a conversation with a fellow traveler named Dilkhush from Bindhekhalpur,Jharkhand. He was working as an administrator in India. Our chat soon drifted into deeper topics—especially one that’s often debated back home: whether bureaucratic exams in India should be limited to just two attempts and have strict age caps. Curious, I asked for his take on the issue. He smiled and said, Two attempts aren’t the problem. The real question is—can you ensure the same resources and opportunities for everyone? He gave a simple yet powerful example: Imagine someone who has completed their education in a remote village of Tamil Nadu. How can their preparation ever match someone who’s had the privilege of studying in Delhi? He went further, raising the issue of language. We impose English on everyone, he said, without first fixing our education system. It creates a divide within society—between those who’ve had access to better schools and those who haven’t. This really made me think. I then raised a counterpoint: But what if someone joins the administration at 40? Doesn’t India lose the chance to train them for longer? He responded thoughtfully, “Do you really think a 21-year-old has seen and understood society better than someone who's lived through its layers for decades? I doubt that.” When I asked him about the hurdles faced by people from rural areas, his response was striking: The system has been built for them, not us. In the U.S., there are still barriers, but there’s also a sense of equal opportunity. Our forefathers were aware of the deep-rooted inequalities in Indian society—that’s why they tried to design a roadmap for inclusion. But the truth is, many still fear people from villages rising to positions of power in bureaucracy. His honesty shook something within me. It challenged a part of my thinking. As we were about to part ways, I asked him, If you could make one big change in India, what would it be? He replied without hesitation: I would change the perception of Indians who block the paths for people from rural areas. Instead of building new hurdles, we should focus on distributing resources equally and welcoming everyone into the vision of India. Before leaving, I handed him a coin with the image of Maa Saraswati on it. I said, May she bless you with wisdom and knowledge. 
On the way back from that trip, his words stayed with me. Maybe our opinions differ, but the concern he raised was real and important. Why do we often focus on creating new barriers in the name of reform, instead of designing inclusive roadmaps that align with the vision of a just and equal India?
<hr/>
